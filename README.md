# Linode-DDNS

This is a DDNS script to update a hostname on your own domain if you have it hosted at Linode. It comes in handy if your on an ADSL connection with a dynamic IP and want to connect to your home/soho lan usng a VPN.

## Install

I run this on a Mac Mini which functions as our home server via cron every 5 minutes.
